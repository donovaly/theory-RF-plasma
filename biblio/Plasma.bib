  Abstract                 = {This paper is a focused review of the effects that polymer structure, including crystalline structure and degree of crystallinity have on the gas barrier properties of EVOH (ethylene vinyl alcohol resins). The practical effect that different processing techniques such as cast film and blown film have on the degree of crystallinity is examined. The influence that the resulting degree of crystallinity has on EVOH's sensitivity to moisture and oxygen barrier properties is described. A practical method of making initial determination of the barrier thickness required for a given packaging application and shelf life is explained.},

  Abstract                 = {Pulsed-DC reactive sputter deposition of dielectric films is a growing practice in the industrial and functional coatings industries. Transition region sputtering offers compositional control and high deposition rates but is possible only with active process feedback and appropriate in-situ instrumentation. Successful techniques use one or more process feedback signals, typically optical emission, partial pressure and/or target voltage. Ease of implementation and cost are highly dependent on system configuration and scale. Effective control systems for such applications usually require significant engineering effort involving sensing hardware, highspeed flow regulation, communication electronics, control electronics and software to interface and control all of the equipment. We have addressed these issues by developing an integrated approach to reactive sputtering process control. All electronics and algorithms with necessary I/O requirements can be incorporated directly into a pulsed-DC power supply. A key feature of our approach is piezo-driven mass flow controllers that replace the usual high voltage piezo-electric valves for fast gas flow control. We demonstrate transition mode control of aluminum-oxygen and silicon-oxygen reactive deposition processes with a novel controller incorporated into a pulsed-DC power supply. We show robustness of this process control scheme with real time data and deposited film properties. INTRODUCTION The sputter deposition of dielectrics has been gaining popularity in the industrial and functional coatings industries for many years. High frequency AC sputtering using RF power and dielectric targets is gradually being replaced by more economical and production friendly mid-frequency AC and pulsed-DC reactive sputtering techniques, but issues with process control, deposition rate and film quality still plague many who are trying to exploit this promising approach. Dielectric deposits can be produced using metallic targets (such as aluminum or silicon) sputtered in the presence of a reactive gas such as oxygen. Power delivery and target materials used in reactive sputtering are typically less expensive than the RF alternatives, but for optimal performance the},

The SiOx filmdeposition on OPP films never improved oxygen gas barrier properties. The inefficacy of the SiOx deposition was due to poor adhesion at the interface between the deposited SiOx and OPP films and also to the formation of cracks in the deposited SiOx film. If prior to the SiOx filmdeposition surface modification of OPP films was done by a combination of the argon plasma treatment and TMOS coupling treatment, this contributed effectively to strong adhesion leading to success in the SiOx deposition on the OPP filmsurface, and then the oxygen gas barrier ability was improved. The oxygen permeation rate through the SiOx-deposited OPP filmwas decreased from2230 to 37–52 cm3/m2/day/atm, which was comparable to that of poly(vinylidene chloride), 55 cm3/m2/day/atm at a film mthickness of 11 mm.},

Â¨ Â¨ Flexible layer systems from polymeric substrates, thin inorganic layers deposited by vacuum coating and additional polymeric layers are frequently in use to obtain high barrier properties, predominantly against oxygen and water vapour. Especially in cases where additional polymeric coatings are able to fill defects in the inorganic layers, barrier properties of the resulting layer systems show a stronger dependence on their thickness. For the transport of condensable substances, especially of water vapour, an additional porosity in the sub-nm-size can be assigned to the inorganic layers. This, however, has a negligible effect on gas permeation. Multilayer structures made from substrates and alternating polymeric and inorganic layers show much better barrier properties than single polymeric substrates coated with single inorganic layers. These improvements, however, are less than previously reported here. Moreover, also in these cases, the condensation of water vapour in sub-nm pores gives much higher rates for the permeation of substances than expected from simple defect models.},

  Abstract                 = {The hollow cathode will be presented as a plasma source for reactive evaporation processes. The hollow cathode generates an arc discharge plasma. This contains a high portion of directed electrons with an enhanced mean energy, the so called low-voltage electron beam (LVEB). The mean energy of the LVEB, in the range of 11 eV, results in a very effective ionization of the gas and vapor particles. Consequently, very high plasma densities can be achieved, which corresponds to high particle densities in high-rate deposition processes. Furthermore, a high self bias potential of about 16 V is obtained on insulating substrates. For the coating of heat-sensitive substrates with high deposition rates a process with a low ratio between thermal load and deposition rate is necessary. The heat flux on plastic substrates has been measured at the reactive Al evaporation process. The overall thermal load of about 4 W/ cm 2 related to a deposition rate of 100 nm / s is low in comparison to other processes. This makes the hollow cathode a favorable tool for the plasma-activated high-rate deposition. The oxide layers deposited by this process show dense and glassy structures even at comparatively low condensation temperatures. This is caused by the high ion current densities in the order of 30 mA / cm 2 . The low ion energy determined by the self bias potential results in relatively low compressive stress below 100 MPa. The low thermal load and the moderate intrinsic stress of the layers makes the hollow cathode plasma-activated deposition (HAD) process the method of choice for the deposition of oxides as abrasion resistant layers on plastic films and sheets.},

First of all, outstanding properties of coated material are needed in comparison to competitive technologies. Beyond this, acceptable costs for the market are decisive for the introduction of PVD technologies into production. This paper gives an overview of the great variety of applications. The deposition rate has a strong influence on coating cost: the higher the rates, the lower the cost.High rates, especially for deposition of oxides, are often considered as being linked to poor layer quality. Plasma activation of vapor is one method to obtain high rates and acceptable properties. Hollow cathode activated deposition process (HAD) and pulsed magnetron sputtering (PMS ) will be explained. Results concerning layer properties will be depicted. An outlook to the future will be derived.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of process parameters such as substrate temperature, degree of plasma activation and pulsed bias voltage on the structure and properties of Al2O3 layers, deposited by electron beam (EB) evaporation at high deposition rates between 1.5 and 3 mmymin are presented. Layers deposited by reactive EB evaporation without plasma activation are amorphous to X-rays and have a porous columnar microstructure up to a substrate temperature of 700 8C. The hardness of these layers ranges between 2.5 and 8 GPa. A drastic improvement of the layer quality can be achieved by intense plasma activation during deposition process using a low voltage electron beam of a hollow cathode arc discharge (hollow cathode activated deposition; HAD process). Even at low substrate temperatures, dense amorphous layers with a hardness of 12 GPa could be deposited. At an enhanced substrate temperature of 700 8C the layers consist of the nanocrystalline g phase with a grain size between 12 and 15 nm. The additional application of a pulsed bias voltage of 75 V results in the formation of a pronounced N110M fiber texture of columnar g nanocrystallites with a lateral grain size between 30 and 40 nm. The development of the texture in the growth direction was investigated by cross-section TEM investigations. A further increase of bias voltage led to a line broadening of the X-ray diffraction reflexes, which can be interpreted by higher defect densities and lower grain size. The hardness of the dense, nanocrystalline g Al2O3 layers ranges between 20 and 22 GPa. Thus, the application of the process for the deposition of wear resistant layers for cutting tools can be taken into account. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
